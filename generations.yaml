A four-door version was added in 1995, significantly expanding its appeal as a family vehicle. Built on GM's GMT400 platform with body-on-frame construction, it offered genuine off-road capability and substantial towing capacity. Engine options centered around V8 powerplants, including the 5.7L small-block. The interior was relatively utilitarian by modern standards but offered good passenger and cargo space.

The interior is completely redesigned with a push-button electronic shifter, available 10.2-inch touchscreen, digital instrument options, and significantly improved materials. The Denali trim received even greater differentiation with a unique interior design featuring genuine wood and hand-finished details. New to this generation is the AT4 trim with off-road focus, featuring standard four-wheel drive, all-terrain tires, skid plates, and red recovery hooks.
