    description: "The original GMC Yukon was introduced as a two-door SUV based on the Sierra pickup truck platform, essentially replacing the Jimmy name for full-size models. A four-door version was added in 1995, significantly expanding its appeal as a family vehicle. Built on GM's GMT400 platform with body-on-frame construction, it offered genuine off-road capability and substantial towing capacity. Engine options centered around V8 powerplants, including the 5.7L small-block. The interior was relatively utilitarian by modern standards but offered good passenger and cargo space. This generation established the Yukon as GMC's premium full-size SUV, positioned as a more upscale alternative to the Chevrolet Tahoe."

Engine options include 5.3L and 6.2L V8s, plus a 3.0L Duramax diesel inline-six for the first time. The interior is completely redesigned with a push-button electronic shifter, available 10.2-inch touchscreen, digital instrument options, and significantly improved materials. The Denali trim received even greater differentiation with a unique interior design featuring genuine wood and hand-finished details. New to this generation is the AT4 trim with off-road focus, featuring standard four-wheel drive, all-terrain tires, skid plates, and red recovery hooks. Technology has advanced to include available features like a power-sliding center console, rear pedestrian alert, and Super Cruise hands-free driving assistance.
